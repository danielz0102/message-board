# Message Board

Simple message board app using Express, made to practice:

- Dynamic content serving with [EJS](https://ejs.co/)
- Request handling and page routing with Express routers and middlewares
- Data persistence with PostgreSQL
- App and database deployment on PaaS platforms ([Koyeb](https://koyeb.com/) and [Neon](https://neon.com/))
